I am a seasoned Senior Mechanical Engineer currently employed at a progressive data health startup located in Chicago, where I specialize in the development of embedded test systems for medical wearables.

With over seven years of professional experience, my expertise spans the realms of manufacturing and product development within the healthcare sector, encompassing roles at both startup ventures and prominent industry players.

My academic foundation includes a comprehensive B.S./M.S. in Biomedical Engineering from The New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, New Jersey. During my academic tenure, I actively contributed to groundbreaking projects in vaccine development and orthopedic implant design, setting the stage for a seamless transition into the dynamic landscape of industrial engineering.

Throughout my career, I have garnered recognition through the acquisition of patents and the publication of scholarly works, reflecting my commitment to innovation and advancement within the field.

Currently, my focus extends beyond individual achievements, as I aspire to impart knowledge and mentorship to the emerging generation of STEM enthusiasts across all age groups. This endeavor involves leveraging my extensive industry experiences to create and disseminate both technical and non-technical materials, thereby fostering an environment conducive to learning and professional growth.
